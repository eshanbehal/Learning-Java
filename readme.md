Hey just started learning java for android.

Will be adding some imp info when needed.


KEEP CHECKING!!!!WILL BE UPDATED SOON..:)

1. Learned about java strings and int.
    
    source code updated .

2. Learned about arithematics and string concatenation

   using variable types like int , double , string , float.

   learnt something really amazing about variable type double

   double - it is used most commonly for the fractional type calculations
            float also does something like this but double here ss used
            mostly.

    and with help of string concatenation we can give more sense to our code and 
    also can add numeric values to the code.
    
     source code updated. Can check if you want to see the use of both.

3. learnt about java classes , use of conditional processing under the classes
   and also some important concepts like encapsulation ie the class consisting of the objects should
   only be able to update the objects or their respective values. No outside class should be allowed 
   to change or add any values to the other class objects.
   
   CONSTRUCTORS: its a method that is called when we create a new new instance of a class.here instances means that
   values of classes are assigned when we creatre actual instance of the class.

   here aalso learnt about the use of "Private" command which is used in start of each variable in order to make them encapsulated.
   
4. Then learnt 2 of most imp concepts GETTER AND SETTER:
    GETTER: method that is used to get value of the field.
    
    SETTER: unlike setter it dosent return a value it does recieve one so written as:
   
     public void set......name of variable(here the variable instance is defined){

                                                                                }

5. At last learnyt in detail about the multiple constructors within the same class
   with the help of constructor overloading.
   
   CoNSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING : when we create copies of a method using the same name
      but with different parameters.
    
   under this by providing the name in next constructor we tell java to use the new construtor created.

   Also learnt about "this" keyword used in here to call whatever matches the parameters 
   or the arguments that we have provided.


   6th JUNE

1. jst started today with learning more about the "this." notatuon in the constructors and the getters
   setters in order to call the instances of of classes with within the class itself.

 

     ADDED THIS INFO MIGHT HELP BEGINNERS..:)
