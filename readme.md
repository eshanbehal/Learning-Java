Hey just started learning java for android.

Will be adding some imp info when needed.


KEEP CHECKING!!!!WILL BE UPDATED SOON..:)

1. Learned about java strings and int.
    
    source code updated .

2. Learned about arithematics and string concatenation

   using variable types like int , double , string , float.

   learnt something really amazing about variable type double

   double - it is used most commonly for the fractional type calculations
            float also does something like this but double here ss used
            mostly.

    and with help of string concatenation we can give more sense to our code and 
    also can add numeric values to the code.
    
     source code updated. Can check if you want to see the use of both.
