Hey just started learning java for android.

Will be adding some imp info when needed.


     KEEP CHECKING!!!!WILL BE UPDATED SOON..:)
    ============================================

1. Learned about java strings and int.
    
    source code updated .

2. Learned about arithematics and string concatenation

   using variable types like int , double , string , float.

   learnt something really amazing about variable type double

   double - it is used most commonly for the fractional type calculations
            float also does something like this but double here ss used
            mostly.

    and with help of string concatenation we can give more sense to our code and 
    also can add numeric values to the code.
    
     source code updated. Can check if you want to see the use of both.

3. learnt about java classes , use of conditional processing under the classes
   and also some important concepts like encapsulation ie the class consisting of the objects should
   only be able to update the objects or their respective values. No outside class should be allowed 
   to change or add any values to the other class objects.
   
   CONSTRUCTORS: its a method that is called when we create a new new instance of a class.here instances means that
   values of classes are assigned when we creatre actual instance of the class.

   here aalso learnt about the use of "Private" command which is used in start of each variable in order to make them encapsulated.
   
4. Then learnt 2 of most imp concepts GETTER AND SETTER:
    GETTER: method that is used to get value of the field.
    
    SETTER: unlike setter it dosent return a value it does recieve one so written as:
   
     public void set......name of variable(here the variable instance is defined){

                                                                                }

5. At last learnyt in detail about the multiple constructors within the same class
   with the help of constructor overloading.
   
   CoNSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING : when we create copies of a method using the same name
      but with different parameters.
    
   under this by providing the name in next constructor we tell java to use the new construtor created.

   Also learnt about "this" keyword used in here to call whatever matches the parameters 
   or the arguments that we have provided.


   6th JUNE
  ============

1. jst started today with learning more about the "this." notatuon in the constructors and the getters
   setters in order to call the instances of of classes with within the class itself.

2. jst learnt about the concept of objects and method calling.

   METHOD SIGNATURE: The concept of the name and parameter put together form this.
           here signature is the name and that what needed to invoke their method.

    under the METHOD CALLING - we create a another java class and call that class with
    the help of the object in another java class.

3. just learnt a really confusing yet imp topic thats ARRAY LISTS AND ENUMS:

   ARRAY LIST : storing a list of items that we can add things and remove things from
       without having to worry about how many items are there.


   ENUM : its a way of having multiple objects for something and where we know that there can
       be only a few things that a field can have thats where its used.

    AT last just learnt further more in detail about the working of the array list....

    Also learnt about the adding and deleting of some of the items from the array list created.
    here used the concept of pickup , drop , and also adding the getters and setters for the new 
    classe objects created with the help of constructors and getters and setters.


    7th june: 
   ===========

1. just started off by learning the basics of inheritance in java:
   In this we define a base class that objects are based on, things that are common for classes
   that use that.Then we can allow a class to define the unique characterstics of itself just like in a game.

2. So here we can have base class ,then somthing inherits from that to make it something else, make it UNIQUE.

   IN JAVA CLASSES CAN INHERIT DIRECTLY FROM ONLY ONE SUPERCLASS SO THE CLASS STRUCTURE ENDS UP BEING STRICTLY 
   HEIRARICHAL.

3. Learnt about 2 of the very imp concepts along with the inheritance concept in the java coding while working on the
   project player.game in java.

   OVERLOADING AND OVERRIDING ANNOTATIONS: under overloading we create a method with the same name and different parameters
   but in overriding we provide a different implementation to the method in the superclass.


   Every class in java extends the object class so the object is at the very top of the class heirarchy.
   
   In the OVERRIDING we create a method same name , same return value and exactly the same parameters as the 
   method defined in the superclass.
